    <string name="description">You don’t need to get behind the wheel to know that the Genesis Coupe is fast. All you have to do is take one look at its design. An aggressive, sculpted front fascia and hood generate attention and high-speed stability. The signature drop-beltline rear windows give the driver better over-the-shoulder visibility. While the dual exhaust and LED tail lights create an impressive sound and appearance that means business. \n\n They’re hard to catch on the run. So your first look at the Genesis Coupe is likely to be when it’s at rest. Enjoy the view of its large, open front grille, LED daytime running lights, dual chrome exhaust tips, LED tail lights and the available 19-inch dark-graphite-finish alloy wheels.</string>
